# Aeolian-dunes-mapping-workflow
Supplementary material of the Daynac et al., 2024 paper: A new workflow for mapping dune features (outline, crestline and defects) combining deep learning and skeletonization from DEM-derived data.

Please cite the use of figures and data on this page with the article doi.

The supplementary material contains an xlsx and KMZ file of the various tables and metrics referred to in the text: 

XLSX
- SM1: review of automated mapping methods.
- SM2: geographical location of training samples and subset type assignment in the U-Net training phase.
- SM3: Metric of training on validation data.
- SM4: Metric of crestlines skeletonization and dune defects extraction on validation data).

KMZ
A 00_KMZ folder contains two files: 
- KMZ of 00_Training_samples data.
- KMZ of 01_Rub_al_khali data.

QGIS data
The QGIS data (QGIS project with outlines, crestlines, defects, and morphometric analysis) presented in the paper is available on request from: jimmy.daynac@univ-lemans.fr

This page will be kept up to date and will soon include the QGIS and Ecognition toolboxes for mapping dunes, crestlines and defects.
